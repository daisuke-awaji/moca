/**
 * AppSync Connection Hook
 *
 * Hook to manage the shared AppSync Events WebSocket connection.
 * Should be called once at the app level to initialize the connection.
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * - useAppSyncConnection() - Initialize the shared connection (call once in App.tsx)
 * - useAppSyncSubscription() - Subscribe to channels (exported from appsyncConnectionStore)
 *
 * The shared connection is managed by appsyncConnectionStore, which handles:
 * - Single WebSocket connection for all subscriptions
 * - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
 * - Re-subscription after reconnection

     * WHY: Empty cleanup function instead of disconnect()
     *
     * We intentionally don't call disconnect() here because:
     * 1. React StrictMode mounts/unmounts components twice in development
     * 2. If we disconnect on unmount, the second mount would reconnect immediately
     * 3. This would cause unnecessary connection churn (disconnect → reconnect)
     *
     * Instead, disconnect is triggered when user state becomes null (logout),
     * which is handled by the if/else block above.
